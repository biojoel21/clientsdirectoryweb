# Client Directory and Newsfeed

This project is a virtual directory of clients, designed to provide essential information about our clients such as their phone number, office floor, and name. The directory is intended to be user-friendly and easily navigable.

In addition to the client directory, the website will also feature a newsfeed. This will keep visitors informed about the latest updates and happenings at the location. The newsfeed will be updated regularly to ensure that the information is current and relevant.

## Features

- **Client Directory**: A comprehensive list of clients with details like phone number, office floor, and name.
- **Newsfeed**: A regularly updated feed of news and updates about the location.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**: Use the command `git clone <repo-url>` to clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the command `cd <project-directory>` to navigate into the project directory.

3. **Create the media/profile_pictures directory**: This project requires a directory to store profile pictures. Use the command `mkdir -p media/profile_pictures` to create this directory.

4. **Install the required packages**: Depending on the language and package manager this project uses, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. For example, if this is a Node.js project, use the command `npm install`. If it's a Python project with a requirements.txt file, use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

5. **Run the application**: Again, this will depend on the project. If it's a Node.js project, you might use `npm start`. If it's a Django project, you might use `python manage.py runserver`.

Remember to replace `<repo-url>` and `<project-directory>` with the actual URL of the repository and the name of the project directory respectively.
