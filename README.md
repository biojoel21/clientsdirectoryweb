# Client Directory and Newsfeed

This project is a virtual directory of clients, designed to provide essential information about our clients such as their phone number, office floor, and name. The directory is intended to be user-friendly and easily navigable.

In addition to the client directory, the website will also feature a newsfeed. This will keep visitors informed about the latest updates and happenings at the location. The newsfeed will be updated regularly to ensure that the information is current and relevant.
